# Boilerplate

This is a repo to create boilerplate for our projects:
- React JS App
- React TS App
- PWA React JS App
- PWA React TS App
- PWA HTML/CSS/JS

## Folder Structure:
- **api**:
Contains the **API Layer** of the application. It will have methods that are responsible for performing API requests and communicating with a server.
- **assets**:
Contains fonts and images.
- **components**:
The only initial directory in this example is **common**. The **common** directory will contain any reusable components that are coomonly used throughout the application. For instance, buttons, form components, and so on.

ToDo List:
- [x] Start Repo :tada:
- [x] Folder architecture.
- [x] Create api-client.js file to handle requests to the server.
- [x] Create useAsync hook to handle Async calls.
- [x] Add SASS to create utilities, components, etc. To maintain our CSS.
- [x] postcss-preset-env to convert modern CSS into something most browsers can understand.
- [ ] Documentation
